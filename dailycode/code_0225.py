# Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of 
# ways it can be decoded. For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be 
# decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'. You can assume that the messages are decodable. 
# For example, '001' is not allowed.
